                        <br><b><big>My Thougth About The Book</big></b>
                        <br>The book was my first adventure novel ever. The author of this book did a good job in
                        writting
                        the characters and complicated expressions.
                        I liked the idea of the wizarding world, it was like a real world that coexist with our own
                        world.
                        It was like watching a movie, each and every scene's detail was greatly explained like
                        expressions
                        on the face, buildings, places etc.
                        I recommend this book to young reader as the language is easy to understand.
