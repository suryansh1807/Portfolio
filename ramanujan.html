                        Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887 in Erode,
                        a small village about 400km southwest of Madras(Chennai).
                        He was one of India’s greatest Mathematical geniuses who
                        lived during the British Rule in India.
                        Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics,
                        he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis,
                        number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions,
                        including solutions to mathematical problems that are
                        considered unsolvable.
                        During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled
                        nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations).
                        Many were completely novel;his original and highly
                        unconventional results, such as the Ramanujan prime,
                        the Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae and mock
                        Theta functions, have opened entire new areas of work and
                        inspired a vast amount of further research. Using one of his
                        identities, mathematicians have been able to calculate the
                        value of π correct to millions of decimal places.
